        <p class="dropcap">Did you know that bees dance? A honey bee uses its dance to tell other bees where to find food, or a new home. The dance of the honey bee is like a map for other bees to follow. Let's build homes and grow flowers for bees, and make them dance! </p>

        <h2>Let's grow flowers to help the bees!</h2>
        
        <p>Ask your parents to help you plant a garden to help out the bees! Bees love a garden full of flowers and plants. Bees are out all day looking for pollen and nectar which comes from flowers like daffodils. Pussy willow and herbs such as rosemary are also delicious for bees. Remember, some bees will keep buzy until fall, so plant some late blooming flowers in your garden.</p>

        <h2>Let's build a home for bees!</h2>
        
        <p>A bundle of hollow sticks makes a nice house for travelling bees. Some bumblebees like to live in bird houses, or plant pots with holes. Put a little bedding in the pot and leave it in a shady area. If you come across a bee nest or swarm, don't go close to it. Most bees don't sting unless teased, but you don't want to be stung by a bumblebee! Ouch! </p>
